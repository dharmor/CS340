# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider # your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the Dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In order to create software that's easy to maintain, read, and adapt, the software needs to be modular. 
As an example, the CRUD module that I created in this course can be used for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. This library was used in Projects One and 
Two and several other assignments without any modifications. Working modularly increases production time and allows for easier troubleshooting and fixing application errors.

 
# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.  How did your approach to this project differ from previous ssignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

    Computer scientists approach software using primary critical thinking. I begin by analyzing the challenge. When I understand the requirements, I can interpret different solutions and decide the best solution. With this, I develop test cases with pass and fail metrics for each requirement. Consequently, I can develop a tool to deal with the challenges, implement test cases, and debug applications.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

In Computer Science, challenges are identified and interpreted, and solutions are tested. It is important to follow this process to deliver usable, high-quality software to a client. To learn and grow from a challenge, you must try to solve it. When software is created modularly, it is easy to replace or implement modules elsewhere, making it a shortcut for companies.

To do a project that would aid a company like Grazioso Salvare, I would first ask them for their requirements. In addition, if they currently use a system what is it they donâ€™t like about it? Understanding their needs and issues is key to creating a successful application. Also, the user interface needs to be intuitive to minimize training and to get the project up and running as soon as possible. A few years ago I ran into this exact issue. The company's current system was difficult to use and it took about 6 months to train someone on the basic operations and extremely slow and crashed a lot. So when I created a solution for them I took all that into account and created a system that someone could be trained in 20 minutes or less, fast and intuitive. I also made the components modular so I could reuse the code in different parts of the system. One aspect that stood out, to me,  was the reports that were used by everyone in the company multiple times a day. Initially, the report took 10 seconds to display (it was a web report). This was frustrating for the client, so I spent a week reworking it. When I finished the report was almost instantaneous and the client no longer noticed a delay. It became a nonissue.
